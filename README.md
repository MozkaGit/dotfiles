# TITLE: dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configuration, allowing for a consistent computing experience across multiple machines.
These days I primarily use GNU/Linux via the [Fedora Linux distribution](https://fedoraproject.org/).

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).  This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

```
stow .
```
